Encapsulation:
- The process of hiding the internal workings of an object and providing a public interface for accessing and manipulating the object's data.

Abstraction:
- The process of representing only the essential features of an object and ignoring the irrelevant details.

Inheritance:
- The process of creating a new class by deriving properties and behaviors from an existing class.

Polymorphism:
- The ability of an object to take on many forms.
- Classes based on the same abstract class can be treated as if they were of the same type.

UML:
- arrow with empty triangle represents the inheritance relationship.
- arrow with diamond represents the composition relationship.
- dashed arrow represents the dependency relationship, i.e. somewhere in the class, we have a reference or dependency on the other class.
